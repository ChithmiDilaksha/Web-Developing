                    Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory.[2] In these systems,
                    students progress through a series of schools that can be built and operated by both government and private organization.
                    The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) but generally include primary 
                    school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher 
                    education is taught is commonly called a university college or university.<br><br>A school is both the educational institution and building designed to provide
